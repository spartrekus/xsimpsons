    Please notice that The Simpsons are created by Matt Groening and
    are the trademarked and copyrighted property of Twentieth Century
    Fox Film Corpoeration...
    I didn't ask for permission, because I didn't found where and why,
    and this is only a free fan software, without commercial aim.
    I take this software away, whenever the Twentieth Century Fox Film
    Corpoeration wants....
