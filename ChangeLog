Original xpenguins 1.2 ChangeLog:
---

* Version 1.2 (22 May 2000)
- Use the X shape extension to allow penguins to negotiate shaped windows
- `-rectwin' option available to bypass calculation of window shape if too slow
- Walker and climber behaviour changed to overcome small obstacles
- Removed whitespace around most penguins images to 30x30 (from 32x32)
- Walker image changed so walker actually on window, not 1 pixel above!
- Fixed bug in ToonAdvance that caused toons to get stuck behind KDE panel
- Renamed functions in toon.c so that all begin with `Toon'
- Tumblers now accelerate under gravity until they reach `terminal velocity'
- Can use `-n' as well as `-penguins' to specify the number of penguins
- Climbers maintain tendency to climb until they next become faller/tumbler
- Every timestep perform check that penguins are not in the window region
- Walkers and climbers now move with the windows they're on (up to a limit)
- Penguins fall in properly from the very top of the screen

* Version 1.1 (26 February 2000)
- Use Xpm attribute `closeness' so that 8-bit displays are supported
- Smoothed the jagged edges of floater image (from Pingus)
- Added the `-ignorepopups', `-version' and `-quiet' options
- Second interupt causes bursting penguins to be immediately erased
- Fixed ToonLocateWindows bug that returned before all windows mapped

* Version 1.0 (28 November 1999)
- Decided that version numbers less than 1 are silly
