XSIMPSONS - the Simpsons walking along the tops of your windows

Version 0.1: you get only Bart!

AUTHOR: Stephan Beyer <PH-Linex@gmx.net> 2000

a Simpsons derivate from the original XPenguins...

I would be happy that xsimpsons will become integrated into xpenguins and
with a gtk configuration tool you can set-up if you want penguins or
Simpsons... That would be great!
It may also be included in WinPenguins or made to WinSimpsons.
This software is without any warranty...
!!! Please notice that The Simpsons are created by Matt Groening and
    are the trademarked and copyrighted property of Twentieth Century
    Fox Film Corpoeration...
    I didn't ask for permission, because I didn't found where and why,
    and this is only a free fan software, without commercial aim.
    I take this software away, whenever the Twentieth Century Fox Film
    Corpoeration wants.... !!!

INTRODUCTION

XPenguins is a simple program that animates a number of penguins that
fall from the top of the screen, walk along the top of windows, up
the side of windows, up the side of the screen, and sometimes even
levitate with their genetically-modified go-go-gadget 'copter
ability. Use the `-h' option to see a list of current options -
currently you can specify the display to send the penguins to, the
delay between frames and the number of penguins that are created.


LICENSE

This program is released under the GNU public license - see COPYING


TODO

Write GUI front end(s) - the first will be an applet for GNOME, but
with a little modularisation of the code it should be easy to write
GUIs for other environments (KDE etc) and update them all together. 

Add some more penguin types.

I'd also be interested to see derivatives of this program that use
other toons completely - e.g. Buzz Lightyear, Sonic the Hedgehog, The
Simpsons etc. 


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The penguin images were taken from `Pingus', a free lemmings clone
for Linux (http://pingus.seul.org/), and were designed by Joel Fauche
<joel.fauche@wanadoo.fr>.
