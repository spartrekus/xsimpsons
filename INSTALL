The Makefile with this distribution should work under Linux, but may
need editing for other UNIX platforms.

Download xsimpsons from: http://lightning.prohosting.com/~sbeyer/
Download xpenguins from: http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~swrhgnrj/xpenguins/

To compile, type:

	make clean
	make

This creates an executable in the current directory called
`xsimpsons'. You can then put this and the manual entry in suitable
directories - for example, as root type: 

	install -s -m 755 -o 0 -g 0 xsimpsons /usr/X11R6/bin/xsimpsons
	install -m 644 -o 0 -g 0 xpenguins.1 /usr/X11R6/man/man1

To change and compile  the variant type:

	make chvar
	make clean
	make
